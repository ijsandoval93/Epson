# Epson

In these files you will see the code I used to program the Epson Robot.

The Epson robot is taught in SPEL+ language.

The software that is being used is Epson RC+ 7.0.

There is only one code for this repository since there was only one robot being programmed.

*Note: Modifications are still possible to this code.
